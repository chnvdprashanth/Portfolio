              I&apos;m a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in
              full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very
              enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of
              software products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design,
              and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matter to me.

              I first got into web development in 2022 during college training,
              which really ignited my passion for creating interactive websites.
              I began with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and then moved on to
              JavaScript to add more functionality. After focusing on front-end
              development, I expanded my skills to the backend with Node.js,
              Express.js, and MongoDB. My growing curiosity led me to machine
              learning in my third year. I dove into Python, explored essential
              math concepts, and worked with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and
              TensorFlow. Although machine learning is vast and challenging,
              itâ€™s become one of my favorite fields to explore.

              I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products
              end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
